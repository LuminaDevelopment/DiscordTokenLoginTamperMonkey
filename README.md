## How To Use❓

simply head to the [discord login page](https://discord.com/login) and there will be a little window in the top right side, simply put your discord token into the field and press "login" and wait a few seconds, then you should be all set!

## Why This❓

Its open source so you cant get token logged from installing it, ye idk what else to say xD.
